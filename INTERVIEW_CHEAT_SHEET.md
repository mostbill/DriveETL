## üéØ Sample Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "Explain how Isolation Forest works for anomaly detection."
**A**: "Isolation Forest works by randomly selecting features and split values to isolate data points. Anomalies are easier to isolate and require fewer splits, resulting in shorter path lengths in the isolation trees. Normal points require more splits and have longer paths. The algorithm assigns anomaly scores based on these path lengths."

### Q: "Why did you choose SQLite over other databases?"
**A**: "SQLite was chosen for its simplicity, zero-configuration setup, and sufficient performance for our data volume. It's embedded, requires no server setup, and provides ACID compliance. For a prototype/demo project, it offers the right balance of functionality and simplicity."

### Q: "How do you handle data quality issues in your ETL pipeline?"
**A**: "The pipeline includes multiple validation layers: schema validation, range checks, null value handling, and duplicate detection. We implement data profiling to understand data patterns and use configurable rules for data cleaning and transformation."

### Q: "What challenges did you face with real-time anomaly detection?"
**A**: "Key challenges included balancing detection sensitivity vs. false positives, handling concept drift in data patterns, and ensuring low-latency processing. We addressed these through configurable thresholds, periodic model retraining, and optimized data structures."

### Q: "How would you scale this system for production?"
**A**: "For production scaling, I'd implement: distributed processing with Apache Kafka/Spark, migrate to PostgreSQL/MongoDB, add containerization with Docker/Kubernetes, implement proper monitoring and alerting, and add data partitioning strategies."

### Q: "Explain your approach to testing the ML pipeline."
**A**: "Testing includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for the full pipeline, data validation tests, model performance tests with known datasets, and regression tests to ensure consistent results across code changes."
